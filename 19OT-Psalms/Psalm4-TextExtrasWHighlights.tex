\begin{compactenum}[I.][8]
	\item  \textbf{Insincere Boldness} -- Do you take a hard stand against something, but in  the details, one could see small compromises on the same issue
	\item \textbf{Imperfect Book} -- Do you really have a perfect book? Do you actually believe  the WORDS that it says?
	\item \textbf{Impure Bride} -- what ``little sins'' of convenience do you overlook (most likely, non-Christians are not overlooking them)
	\item \textbf{Insincere Brethren} -- Don't pretend to care, if you don't $\hdots$  don't say you pray or will pray when you don't or won't $\hdots$ And why do you not care  anyway?
	\item \textbf{Inordinate Bonds} - (Ezekiel 23:11) Who or what are you beholden to? Who are you secretly trying to be like?
	\item \textbf{Inconsistent Beliefs} -- How much or your beliefs actually are not scriptural? And how would you react when someone showed you?
	\item \textbf{Invisible Blessings} -- if you say you are a Christian, who are you being a blessing to?
	\item A\textbf{(Mis)Interpreted Bible} -- Do  you REALLY understand the Bible, or just take the word of the guy in the pulpit?
