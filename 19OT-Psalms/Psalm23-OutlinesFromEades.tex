Restoration can be often more difficult then making something brand new. I know this from trying to restore old cars and old houses. 
*Any kind of restoration involves a realization of these three truths:\\
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
    \item Something is deteriorating
    \item Something needs demolished
    \item Something needs dreamed up
    \item Something needs done\\
\end{compactenum}
All of us at one time or another will face the need for Restoration in our lives ... that restoration may be bodily, broken mentally-spiritually, or the bank account.
Psalms 51:12
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
The Bible mentions the word restore 66 times. It was said of Boaz in the Old Testament that he would be a restorer of Naomi's life. The same could be said about our Savior Jesus Christ.\\
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
    \item He restores my belief in God (soul)
    \item He restores my Brokenness from grief (sadness)
    \item He restores my body to Glory (sickness)
    \item He restores my boldness to give (service)\\
\end{compactenum}

The word "shepherd" appears in the Bible 74 times. The Egyptians and most people of the world considered shepherding as an inferior job. They were look down upon us the most slowly of people. It's interesting that when the Lord came he referred to himself as a shepherd of people. He chose Shepherd to be the first to receive the announcement of the baby born in the manger and allowed them to be the first to go into Jerusalem to tell people what had happened in Bethlehem. And the points below, there are scriptures relating to God as Shepherd in these ways:\\
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
    \item HE IS THE PERSONAL SHEPHERD-("my")
    \item HE IS THE POWERFUL SHEPHERD-("chief")
    \item HE IS THE PROVIDING SHEPHERD-("good")
    \item HE IS THE PERMANENT SHEPHERD-("great")\\
\end{compactenum}
