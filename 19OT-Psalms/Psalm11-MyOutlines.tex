\section{Psalm 11 Outlines}

\subsection{My Outlines}

\subsubsection{God is Watching}
\textbf{Introduction: }Remember the popular song a number of years back, ``God is Watching Us, from a Distance?'' This song has some bad theology, diestic theology, that God is sitting back, detached from mankind. The song echoes the mantra of universal-ism, where everyone is one of God's children, when only the redeemed are so. Psalm 11 tells a different story. God is at a distance, but that distance is the distance from our heads to our hearts, it is the distance of our fingers to the pages of a Bible.  God is (1) actually very near, (2) available for all who seek him, (3) apparent for those who do not choose to ignore Him:%\footnote{11 November 2014 -- \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.25,0.00}{\hyperlink{PsalmsTOC}{Return to end of Table of Contents.}}}
