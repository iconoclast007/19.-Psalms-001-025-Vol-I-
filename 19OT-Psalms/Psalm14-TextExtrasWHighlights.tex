\textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{The fool hath said in his heart, \emph{There} \emph{is} no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, \emph{there} \emph{is} none that doeth good.}\footnote{From Kidner, the spirit of godlessness reveals itself in two ways:  in flouting God's law (1-3) and oppressing His people (4-6); that is, in both direct and indirect contempt of heaven. It is the reckless folly (1a,2b, 4a) almost as much as the wickedness of it that energes in the psalm, which `looks down from heaven' on the scene as God views it. But the standpoint changes in the last verse to the earthly arena, where persecuted Israel waits longingly for the redress that will surely come. The psalm is almost exactly duplicated in Psalm 53, where, however, the term `God' replaces `The Lord'. \cite{kidner2014psalmsV1} }

These are the people who swear by ``plenary, verbally inspired'' scraps of paper that contain a DEAD language on them. These are the people that would call you a ``heretic'' for correcting their banal, benighted, bewildered, tedious, misinformed BUNKO with the Authorized Version. Had enough? Ready for some Scripture instead of the ``original Hebrew''? \begin{compactenum}
%\item People in the Bible EAT people (Lam. 4:10; Deut. 28:53–56; 2 Kings 6:29). Is that clear? Do you understand that?

%\item Israelites will be eaten (Isa. 6:13). Do you understand THAT?
%\item Someone goes after a Jew to eat his flesh (Ps. 27:2).
%\item Someone who professed to drink literal blood every Sunday morning at eleven o’clock, offers drink offerings of blood (Ps. 16:4). Any trouble yet?
%\item When you sacrifice at an altar, you cut off the head of the victim (Lev. 1:12). When you sacrifice people (Rev. 6:9) you cut off their heads (Rev. 20:4). Any problem? What is the problem?
