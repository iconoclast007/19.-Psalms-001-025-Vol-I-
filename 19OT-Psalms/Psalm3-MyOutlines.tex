Commentators remind us that Psalm 3 recounts God's protection of David during Absalom's rebellion. (See the story in 2 Samuel 15:13-17:22). This was a time of: 

\begin{compactenum}[I.]
    \item \textbf{Personal Heartache} - - and heartbreak, but by God's grace and mercy, it was also a time of:
    \item \textbf{Persistent Help} (verses 3, 4, 5, 7)
    \item \textbf{Protected Head} - - God protected both David's physical head and David's throne, the headship as king (verse 3)
    \item A \textbf{Penitential Heart} - - no doubt that David fully realized that Absalom's rebellion, along with many other family problems, results from his sin with Bathsheba. David was never the same after this succession of sin.  He lived with his sorrow.
    \item \textbf{Purifying and Healing} - - there is nothing like God letting us reap the seed we have sown to let us experience his mercy. It is both a purifying and healing process to go through this.  God delivers and cleanses, yet again. 
    \item \textbf{Preserved Honor} - - David gets restored back to the throne, and Absalom is killed by Joab
    \item An \textbf{Ever-Present Hope}
