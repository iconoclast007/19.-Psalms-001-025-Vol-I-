\textbf{Introduction: }In the latter part of this song David mentions the fact that the wicked think they are getting by with their sins. He reminds them that God sees all of the mischief and that he will require it one day at judgment. Hebrews 9 says it is appointed unto man once to die and after this the judgment.
